 Print out what you think 10 + 2 * 5 evaluates to. Then print out the actual expression (i.e. `print(10 + 2 * 5)`)
 */
// What I think it evaluates to: 20
print(10 + 2 * 5)

// Actual expression:
print(10 + (2 * 5))


//:  In a separate `print` statement, add in the necessary parentheses so that addition takes place before multiplication.
print((10 + 2) * 5)


//:  Print out what you think 4 * 9 - 6 / 2 evaluates to. Then print out the actual expression.
// What I think it evaluates to: 33
print(4 * 9 - 6 / 2)

// Actual expression:
print((4 * 9) - (6 / 2))


//:  In a separate `print` statement, add in the necessary parentheses so that the subtraction is prioritized over the multiplication and division.
print(4 * (9 - 6) / 2)
